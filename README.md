# Treatment Review Collector

An AI-powered system for collecting and analyzing reliable medical treatment reviews that match specific clinical trial criteria.

## üéØ Problem Statement

When researching medical treatments, especially those from older clinical trials (e.g., from 2015), it's challenging to find genuine, reliable reviews from people who actually underwent similar therapy protocols. This system addresses the Linear issue **DAV-5** by:

1. **Defining reliable reviews**: Reviews from real people who underwent therapy matching clinical trial parameters
2. **Filtering AI-generated content**: Using multiple detection methods to identify fake/AI-generated reviews
3. **Matching clinical criteria**: Ensuring reviews align with specific trial protocols and timelines

## üîß Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-source Review Collection**: Crawls medical forums, patient communities, and review sites
- **AI Content Detection**: Identifies AI-generated or suspicious reviews using pattern matching and linguistic analysis
- **Clinical Trial Matching**: Matches reviews against specific trial criteria (therapy type, duration, dosage, side effects)
- **Source Credibility Assessment**: Evaluates review source reliability and user authenticity
- **Temporal Relevance**: Prioritizes reviews from relevant time periods relative to clinical trials

### Technical Features
- **Comprehensive Reliability Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring system (0-1 scale)
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjustable reliability criteria
- **Multiple Output Formats**: JSON, CSV, database storage
- **Rate-Limited Crawling**: Respectful web scraping with configurable delays
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line tools

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Davz33/treatment-review-collector.git
cd treatment-review-collector

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install advanced AI detection models
pip install torch transformers sentence-transformers
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Collect reliable reviews for a specific therapy
python main.py collect \
  --therapy-name "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy" \
  --condition "chronic pain" \
  --trial-year 2015 \
  --duration-weeks 12 \
  --max-reviews 100 \
  --threshold 0.6

# Analyze existing reviews from a file
python main.py analyze reviews.json \
  --therapy-name "CBT" \
  --condition "chronic pain" \
  --trial-year 2015

# Test a single review
python main.py test-review "I tried CBT for 12 weeks in 2016 for chronic pain. Initially felt more anxious but by week 8 saw real improvements..."

# Search for related clinical trials
python main.py search-trials --therapy-name "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy" --condition "chronic pain"
```

## üìä How It Works

### 1. Reliability Detection Framework

The system uses a multi-factor approach to assess review reliability:

```python
# Example: Creating clinical trial criteria
trial_criteria = ClinicalTrialCriteria(
    therapy_name="Cognitive Behavioral Therapy",
    year=2015,
    duration_weeks=12,
    condition_treated="chronic pain",
    side_effects_mentioned=["initial anxiety", "fatigue"]
)

# Initialize detector
detector = ReliableReviewDetector(trial_criteria)

# Analyze a review
is_reliable, score = detector.is_reliable_review(review_text, metadata)
```

### 2. Scoring Components

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Authenticity** | 35% | Human vs AI-generated content detection |
| **Clinical Match** | 30% | Alignment with trial parameters |
| **Source Credibility** | 20% | Platform and user reliability |
| **Temporal Relevance** | 15% | Time proximity to clinical trial |

### 3. AI Detection Methods

- **Pattern Matching**: Detects common AI phrases and structures
- **Linguistic Analysis**: Identifies repetitive or overly structured content
- **Medical Disclaimer Detection**: Flags generic medical advice patterns
- **Advanced Models** (optional): Transformer-based AI detection

### 4. Clinical Matching Criteria

- Therapy name and type mention
- Treatment duration alignment
- Dosage and frequency information
- Known side effects from trial data
- Medical terminology usage
- Condition-specific keywords

## üìà Example Results

### Sample Reliable Review (Score: 0.85)
```
"I started CBT for my chronic pain in 2016 after reading about the study. 
The 12-week program was challenging at first - I felt more anxious initially, 
but by week 8 I noticed real improvements. The techniques for pain management 
really helped me cope better. Some fatigue in the beginning but that went away."

‚úÖ Authenticity: 0.9 (Human-like language)
‚úÖ Clinical Match: 0.8 (Mentions duration, timeline, known side effects)
‚úÖ Source Credibility: 0.7 (Verified platform user)
‚úÖ Temporal Relevance: 0.9 (Posted year after 2015 trial)
```

### Sample Unreliable Review (Score: 0.25)
```
"I hope this helps with your decision about CBT therapy. It's important to note 
that everyone's experience may vary with this treatment. From my perspective, 
the cognitive behavioral therapy approach offers several advantages: 
1. Evidence-based treatment methods 2. Structured approach to pain management..."

## üìö Implementation Ideas & Approaches

### 1. Small Language Model Approach (Your Suggestion)
- **Pros**: Can be trained specifically for medical review detection
- **Cons**: Requires training data and computational resources
- **Implementation**: Use models like DistilBERT fine-tuned on medical vs AI text

### 2. Pattern-Based Detection (Current Implementation)
- **Pros**: Fast, interpretable, no model training required
- **Cons**: May miss sophisticated AI-generated content
- **Implementation**: Rule-based system with medical domain knowledge

### 3. Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- **Pros**: Combines speed of patterns with accuracy of ML models
- **Cons**: More complex to implement and maintain
- **Implementation**: Pattern matching as first filter, ML models for edge cases

### 4. Off-the-shelf Tools Integration
Available tools for AI detection:
- **GPTZero**: General AI content detection
- **Copyleaks**: Plagiarism and AI detection
- **OpenAI Classifier**: GPT-generated text detection
- **Turnitin**: Academic AI detection
